# 🧠 Build an LLM from Scratch

This project is my hands-on journey in **building a Large Language Model (LLM)** completely from scratch — following tutorials from the **Vizuara YouTube channel by Dr. Raj Dandekar** and inspired by the book ***“Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)”* by Sebastian Raschka**.


## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand **how modern LLMs like GPT work under the hood** — from tokenization to training and inference.
I’m not just using pretrained models, but actually **implementing core components step-by-step** to deeply learn the mechanics behind them.
